### Inverse Functions:  

First of all, what is a function?

#### The most general answer
**Definition (of a function):** $f$ is a function if $f$ has a **domain** $D$  and a **codomain** $C$  such that for every elements $x\in D$ there exists a unique element $f(x)\in C$. 

Abbreviated as                 $f:D\to C$ 

$f$  is the name of the function.

The domain $D$ is the set of **input values**.    Usually we write $D=dom(f)$.

The codomain $C$  is the set of **possible** **output values**.    $C=cod(f)$

What is the **range** of a function?

$range(f)=\{f(x)\mid x\in D\}$

In English this says that $range(f)$ is the set of all elements $f(x)$ where $x$ ranges over all elements of the domain.

In general, functions can process lots of different kinds of objects (not just numbers). E.g. we can have a function $f$ such that $f(x)= \text{firstname}(x)$.

What is the domain of $f$? Well, it should be a set of things that **have a first name**, e.g. the set of students in this bootcamp.

Then $dom(f)=$ the students in this bootcamp,

$cod(f)=$ the set of all possible first names, and

$range(f)=$ the set of first names of students in this bootcamp.

#### A slightly simpler answer for this bootcamp
Often we just use functions that have **real numbers** as input and output.

The set of real numbers is denoted by $\mathbb R$.

We can also use interval notation $(-\infty,\infty)=\mathbb R$.

In geometry, $\mathbb R$ is pictured as an infinite **line** from left to right (the **number line**).

**Definition** (of a function **on real numbers**): $f$ is a function on (some) real numbers if $f$ has a **domain** $D$ which is a subset of the set $\mathbb R$ of all real numbers (written $D\subseteq\mathbb R$) such that for every real number $x\in D$ the function $f$ produces a **unique real number** $f(x)$. 

Abbreviated as                 $f:D\to \mathbb R$ 

$f$  is the name of the function.

The domain $D$ is the set of **input values**.    Usually we write $D=dom(f)$.

For many functions $dom(f)=\mathbb R$.    E.g. quadratics $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ 

But there are other functions where $dom(f)\subsetneq\mathbb R$.   E.g.  $\sqrt{\quad}$ , $f(x)=1/x$

What is the **range** of a function?

$range(f)=\{f(x)\mid x\in D\}$

In English this says that $range(f)$ is the set of all elements $f(x)$ where $x$ ranges over all elements of the domain.

#### When are two functions equal?

In mathematics it is **very useful** to properly understand when two things are equal (i.e. exactly the same).

**Definition of equality of functions**: Two functions $f$ and $g$  are equal, written $f=g$, if they have the same domain, i.e., $dom(f)=dom(g)$, and $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x\in dom(f)$.

Short version: $f=g\iff dom(f)=dom(g)\text{ and }\forall_{x\in dom(f)} f(x)=g(x)$


#### What is the difference between $f$ and $f(x)$?

$f$ and $f(x)$ are often used interchangeably to refer to a function, but there is actually an important distinction.

$f$  is the **name** of a function (could also be $g,h,\log,\sin,\cos,\dots$).

$f(x)$ is the **value** of a function with input $x$. So if $x$ is a given a specific number as value, then $f(x)$ will be exactly one number as a result, which means that $f(x)$ is not a function.

This can be an important distinction: $f^{-1}(x)$  is the value of the inverse of $f$ when the number $x$ is given as input.

This is **very different** from $f(x)^{-1}$  which is the reciprocal of $f(x)$, i.e. $f(x)^{-1}={1\over f(x)}$ which has **nothing to do** with the inverse of $f$.

This is not just being pedantic. Mathematical notation is supposed to be useful when we calculate with symbols, so it helps (a lot) if we understand it properly.

Note: The reciprocal $x^{-1}={1\over x}$ is sometimes also called the **multiplicative inverse** of $x$. But it is not an inverse function of $x$ since $x$ is a number rather than a function.

Also, $f(x)^{-1}$ is different from $f(x^{-1})=f({1\over x})$.  This is because, by convention, function application has priority over exponent notation. 

However, $2x^{-1}=2(x)^{-1}={2\over x}$ because $2$ is a number and not the name of a function! The difference is that $2x$ means "$2$ times $x$" rather than a function called $2$ applied to a variable $x$.

### Definition of the inverse of a function

A function $f$ takes an element, say $x$, as input from its **domain** and produces an output $f(x)$ in its **range**.

The **inverse** of a function $f$ **(if it exists)** does the reverse:  it is **supposed to** take each element $y$ in $range(f)$ and produce **the original** element $x$ in $dom(f)$ such that $f(x)=y$.

The name of the inverse of $f$ is $f^{-1}$.

So if $y=f(x)$  then we want $f^{-1}(...)=...$

There are two issues with this idea.

1. We want input values for $f^{-1}$ to use the variable $x$ and want to call the output $y$. This is easy to fix: just swap $x$ and $y$.

 2. When does the inverse $f^{-1}$ function exist?

Example: $f(x)=x^2$

`plot(x^2)=?`
Does it have an inverse? 

Many students think that the square root function $\sqrt{\ }$ is the inverse of $x^2$.

This is not completely wrong, but it is half wrong  :).

What is $\sqrt{x^2}=$ ?

Well, when $x=2$, we have $x^2=...$

So $\sqrt{2^2}=2$, which means that the square root reversed the effect of the square.

But what happens when $x=-2$?

Then $x^2=(-2)^2=\dots$ 

So $\sqrt{(-2)^2}=\sqrt{\dots}=\dots$

The problem is that .....

A function will have an inverse **exactly when** for any element $y$ in the range of $f$ there is a **unique element** $x$ in domain of $f$ such that $f(x)=y$

This property is important and has a special name:

**Definition of one-to-one:** A function $f$ is **one-to-one** if for all distinct elements $x_1\ne x_2$ in the domain of $f$ it follows that $f(x_1)\ne f(x_2)$.

Short version: $f$ is 1-1 if $\forall_{x_1,x_2}(x_1\ne x_2\implies f(x_1)\ne f(x_2))$

(The arrow $\implies$ means "implies". The symbol $\forall$ means "for all")

**Contrapositive** version (which is equivalent):
$$f\text{ is 1-1 if }\forall_{x_1,x_2}(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\implies x_1=x_2)$$
(In English: a function is 1-1 if whenever $f$ maps $x_1$ and $x_2$ to the same value, then $x_1$ and $x_2$ are equal.)

How can we see on a graph whether a function is one-to-one?

This has a special name (which you have probably heard many times):

**Definition of horizontal line test**: A set $S$ of points in $xy$-plane satisfies the **horizontal line test** if every horizontal line on the $xy$-plane intersects the graph of $f$ at **most in one point**.

**The horizontal line test theorem:** A function $f$ is one-to-one if and only if the graph of $f$ satisfies the horizontal line test.

Finally we get to the main definition:

**Definition of inverse function:** Let $f$ be a one-to-one function. Then the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is defined by
$$y=f^{-1}(x) \iff f(y)=x$$
for all $x\in range(f)$ and all $y\in dom(f)$

Notice that it **follows from this definition** that $dom(f^{-1})=range(f)$ and $range(f^{-1})=dom(f)$.



How do we **find the inverse** of a function given by $y = f(x)$: 

a) First write $x = f(y)$ (switch $x$ and $y$)  

b) Then solve for $y$. This expression for $y$ in terms of $x$ is the inverse function for $f$.

Example 1: $y = 2x+3$
> [!question]- a) Switch $x$ and $y$
> $x=2y+3$

> [!question]- b) Solve for $y$
> $2y+3=x$  [flip equation]
> $2y=x-3$  [subtract 3 on both sides]
> $y=\frac12(x-3)$       [multiply by $\frac12$]
> $y = \frac12x -\frac32$ [distribute]

Example 2: Find the inverse of $y=x^2$. 



Solving equations can be difficult (sometimes impossible).

But inverse function can be understood graphically **without solving equations**!

Let's graph the example above:
`plot(2x+3,(1/2)*x-3/2,[-10,10])=?` 
Let's include the line $y=x$ as well:
`plot(2x+3,(1/2)*x-3/2,x,[-10,10])=?`
### Graph of the Inverse function

The graph of the inverse of a function is the **mirror image** of the graph of the function about the line $y=x$.

Example:

$y = f(x) = x^2 âˆ’ 2$

a) Graph the function. 
b) Find the inverse. 
c) Graph the inverse.

Is the inverse a function?

How do we check whether the inverse of a function is also a function? 

>[!question]- **Definition:** A function $f$ is **one-to-one** if
> for all $x_1\ne x_2$ in the domain of $f$ we have $f(x_1)\ne f(x_2)$

...

Horizontal Line Test:

Logarithms ARE Exponents:

$y = b^x$

What will the inverse do? (In English).  
Inverse gets x as output and y as input.  
How can we phrase a question in English such that the answer(output) is $x$?

Def of Logarithm

Solve for $x$.

$\log_3 x = âˆ’2$

$\log_x 4 = 3$

$\log_8 4 = x$

Special Identities

$b^{\log_b x} =x$

$\log_bb^x =x$

$\log_{10} 10^6 =$

$\log_e e =$

Simplify:

$\log_4(\log_5 5)$

### Graph of the Logarithm function.

Use the graph of the exponential $b^x$ to plot the graph of its inverse, $\log_ bx$

Do this for both cases: $b > 1$ and $0< b < 1$.

Note:  
Input to the logarithm function is always positive. Why? 

Log of -ve numbers is NOT defined. Why? 

Log of 0 (to any base) is  

Log of what is 0?

Properties of Logarithms.

1. $\log_b (xy)$
2. $\log_b (\frac xy)$
3. $\log_b (x^y)$

##### Proof of 2:
 $\log_b (\frac xy)$              we use $x=b^{\log_b x}$ and .......
 $=\log_b({b^{\log_b x}\over b^{\log_b y}})$    now use  .......
 $=\log_b(b^{\log_b x-\log_b y})$  and finally we use $z=b^{\log_b z}$ 



Use properties of logarithms to expand each function as much as possible.

$\log_2y^5$ 

$\log_b \frac{xy} z$

$\log_9 \sqrt[3] z$  

$\log_8\sqrt[3]{xy^6}$ 

Solve for x:

$\log_4(x âˆ’ 2) âˆ’ \log_4(x + 1) = 1$

$\log_{27}(x) + \log_{27}(x + 8) =\frac23$

### Common Logarithms and Natural Logarithms.

If $\log_b x=y$ then ...

Specifically, if $b= 10$ then $x =$

$x$ is called the Antilogarithm of $y$.

Example:  
$\log 25 = 1.39794$ (What is the base?)

Infer the scale of the antilogarithm from the logarithm  

$\log x = -2.4179$  

This says the logarithm of $x$ to the base ....... is between $-2$ and $-3$

Therefore we infer, $x$ is between .........

We can find the exact value of $x=$ 

### Applications:

**Example 1:** If an earthquake has a shockwave T times greater than the smallest shockwave that can be measured on a seismograph, then the magnitude M on the Richter

scale is given by:

$M = \log_{10} T$

1906 San Francisco earthquake was $8.3$ on Richter Scale 1971 San Fernando earthquake was $6.6$ on Richter Scale.

Find T for each quake and find how much stronger the San Francisco one was compared to the San Fernando one.


**Example 2:** pH  - A scale to measure acidity.

pH $= âˆ’\log[H^+]$ (The negative log of the concentration of Hydrogen ions measured in moles per liter).

The concentration of hydrogen ions in acid rain known to kill fish is  
$3.2 \times 10^{âˆ’5}$ mole per liter. Find the pH of this acid rain (to the nearest 10th).

Before we calculate, can we guess?

### Natural Logarithms  

When the base of the logartihm is '$e$', we call it a natural logarithm.

We use a special symbol $\ln x$ to mean $\log_e x$

$\ln x = \log_e x$  

All the properties of logarithms holds for natural logarithms as well.

Use the properties of logarithms to expand the expression $\ln Ae^{âˆ’2t}$

If $\ln 2 = 0.6931$, $\ln 3 =1.0986$, and $\ln 5 = 1.6094$ find the following:

a) $\ln 10$

b) $\ln 1/3=?$ 

c) $\ln81=$ 


**Change of base theorem**: for $a,b,x>0$ and $a\ne1\ne b$, $$\log_a x=\frac{\log_b x}{\log_b a}$$

How is this useful?

Proof: $a^{\log_a x} = x$ (from identity)

Using the change of base property and a calculator find a decimal approximation of

$\log_5 462$

#### When are two number equal?

In mathematics it is **very useful** to properly understand when two things are equal (i.e. exactly the same).

E.g. two real numbers in decimal form are equal if they have the same sign and exactly the same digits in the same order. Is this correct???? 

Actually NO  :) 

$1/4={1\over 4}=0.25=0.2499999\dots=0.24\bar9$
