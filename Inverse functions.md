### Inverse Functions:  

What is a function?
Remember the "machine" interpretation of a function.  
Takes an element as input from DOMAIN and gives an output in RANGE.

An inverse of a function does the opposite.

How to find the inverse of a function given by $y = f(x)$: 
a) First write $x = f(y)$ (switch $x$ and $y$)  
b) Then, solve for $y$. This expression for $y$ in terms of $x$ is the inverse function for $f$.

Example: $y = 2x+3$
> [!question]- a) Switch $x$ and $y$
> $x=2y+3$

> [!question]- b) Solve for $y$
> $2y+3=x$  [flip equation]
> $2y=x-3$  [subtract 3 on both sides]
> $y=\frac12(x-3)$       [multiply by $\frac12$]
> $y = \frac12x -\frac32$ [distribute]

Solving equations can be difficult (sometimes impossible).

### Graph of the Inverse function

The graph of the inverse of a function is the **mirror image** of the graph of the function about the line $y=x$.

Example:

$y = f(x) = x^2 − 2$

a) Graph the function. 
b) Find the inverse. 
c) Graph the inverse.

Is the inverse a function?

How do we check whether the inverse of a function is also a function? 

>[!question]- **Definition:** A function $f$ is **one-to-one** if
> for all $x_1\ne x_2$ in the domain of $f$ we have $f(x_1)\ne f(x_2)$

...

Horizontal Line Test:  
If a horizontal line crosses the graph of the function in more than one place

then the function is NOT a one-to-one function. Then the inverse is ________.

How to write the Inverse function of y=f(x)?

A summary of Functions, Relations, and Inverses
 ...

Logarithms ARE Exponents:

$y = b^x$

What will the inverse do? (In English).  
Inverse gets x as output and y as input.  
How can we phrase a question in English such that the answer(output) is $x$?

Def of Logarithm

Solve for $x$.

$\log_3 x = −2$

$\log_x 4 = 3$

$\log_8 4 = x$

Special Identities

$b^{\log_b x} =x$

$\log_bb^x =x$

$\log_{10} 10^6 =$

$\log_e e =$

Simplify:

$\log_4(\log_5 5)$

### Graph of the Logarithm function.

Use the graph of the exponential $b^x$ to plot the graph of its inverse, $\log_ bx$

Do this for both cases: $b > 1$ and $0< b < 1$.

Note:  
Input to the logarithm function is always positive. Why? 

Log of -ve numbers is NOT defined. Why? 

Log of 0 (to any base) is  

Log of what is 0?


Properties of Logarithms.

1. $\log_b (xy)$
2. $\log_b (\frac xy)$
3. $\log_b (x^y)$


Use properties of logarithms to expand each function as much as possible.

$\log_2y^5$ 

$\log_b \frac{xy} z$

$\log_9 \sqrt[3] z$  

$\log_8\sqrt[3]{xy^6}$ 

Solve for x:

$\log_4(x − 2) − \log_4(x + 1) = 1$

$\log_{27}(x) + \log_{27}(x + 8) =\frac23$

### Common Logarithms and Natural Logarithms.

If $\log_b x=y$ then ...

Specifically, if $b= 10$ then $x =$

$x$ is called the Antilogarithm of $y$.

Example:  
$\log 25 = 1.39794$ (What is the base?)

Infer the scale of the antilogarithm from the logarithm  

$\log x = -2.4179$  

This says the logarithm of $x$ to base __ is between $-2$ and $-3$

Therefore we infer, $x$ is between

We can find the exact value of $x$ as

### Applications:

If an earthquake has a shockwave T times greater than the smallest shockwave that can be measured on a seismograph, then the magnitude M on the Richter

scale is given by:

$M = \log_{10} T$

1906 San Francisco earthquake was $8.3$ on Richter Scale 1971 San Fernando earthquake was $6.6$ on Richter Scale.

Find T for each quake and find how much stronger the San Francisco one was compared to the San Fernando one.


pH  - A scale to measure acidity.

pH $= −\log[H^+]$ (The negative log of the concentration of Hydrogen ions measured in moles per liter).

The concentration of hydrogen ions in acid rain known to kill fish is  
$3.2 \times 10^{−5}$ mole per liter. Find the pH of this acid rain (to the nearest 10th).

Before we calculate, can we guess?

### Natural Logarithms  

When the base of the logartihm is '$e$', we call it a natural logarithm.

We use a special symbol $\ln x$ to mean $\log_e x$

$\ln x = \log_e x$  

All the properties of logarithms holds for natural logarithms as well.

Use the properties of logarithms to expand the expression $\ln Ae^{−2t}$

If $\ln 2 = 0.6931$, $\ln 3 =1.0986$, and $\ln 5 = 1.6094$ find the following:

a) $\ln 10$

b) $\ln 1/3$ 

c) $\ln 81$


**Change of base theorem**: for $a,b,x>0$ and $a\ne1\ne b$, $$\log_a x=\frac{\log_b x}{\log_b a}$$

How is this useful?

Proof: $a^{\log_a x} = x$ (from identity)

Using the change of base property and a calculator find a decimal approximation of

$\log_5 462$
